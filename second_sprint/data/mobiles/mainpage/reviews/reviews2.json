Following the similar trend, Xiaomi this year is back with the two devices Xiaomi Redmi 3s and the Xiaomi Redmi 3s Plus.

                "India as a market has been very receptive towards devices that serve the purpose, both of a smartphone and a tablet. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that most manufacturers today include a phablet in their catalogue. When it comes to iBall, a smartphone manufacturer from India, the Cobalt 6 sits in there as their offering for the users who are interested in phablet devices."
            ],
            "Display & Design": [
                "The Cobalt 6 comes with a 6 inch Full HD display, which gives the phone a pixel density of 367 PPI, which should make for a nice reading as well as multimedia consumption experience. The design of the phone is largely plastic, though you do have a soft touch feel on the back. Other than that, the design is rather uninspiring and you have the candybar form factor on the iBall Cobalt 6. The chassis on the phone sees the overall thickness to be around 8.9mm."
            ],
            "Hardware and Features": [
                "Powering the Cobalt 6 is an Octa-core 1.7GHz chipset with A7 cores. There is 2GB of RAM, which should deliver you enough power and memory to be able to do most of the everyday tasks without much hiccup. One positive thing for the phone is that it comes with read and write support for 15 regional languages in India. On the software side of the story, you get slightly dated Android 4.4 Kitkat."
            ],
            "Camera & Storage": [
                "The rear camera on the Cobalt 6 is a 16MP sensor with BSI sensor and a Dual LED flash on the back. This LED flash can not just help you out when taking shots in dim light, but also can double up as a torch using any supported torch application. The front facing camera is an 8MP sensor with Auto Focus, that should suffice for your needs for clicking selfies and video calling."
            ],
            "Battery and Connectivity": [
                "iBall Cobalt 6 ships with 3000mAh battery out of the box. While, this may not be enough for the phone to be counted among the big battery phones, this should get you through a day on light usage. However, anything beyond that and you can expect the phone to look for its charger before it is time to go to bed. There is no LTE here, though you do have 3G support on both the SIM cards that the phone can use. The SIM slots here utilise Full sized SIM cards instead of micro or nano SIM. There is WiFi connectivity alongside Bluetooth here. There is also USB OTG support."
            ],
            "Competition": [
                "In the Rs 8,000 range, the phones that really could give the iBall Cobalt 6 run for its money are the Coolpad Note 3 and the Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus. If you can raise your budget a little, which we would recommend you to, devices like the Redmi Note 3 and the LeEco Le 1s would be excellent choices."

                "The Motorola Moto G Second Generation is one of the most popular smartphones in the budget smartphone category. Initially at launch in September 2014, Motorola had decided to launch the phone with only support for 3G. However, with a fierce competition from the likes of Xiaomi RedMi 2 Prime, Lenovo K3 Note and the Yu Yureka Plus in the sub Rs 10,000 category, and in order to keep the phone relevant and up to speeds, a new LTE version of what is arguably the most popular Motorola device was released in 2015. The new Moto G Second Gen from the outside is exactly the same device as the original Moto G Second Gen. If you were to go into nitty gritty details of the phone, then the LTE version weighs 6 grams more than the 3G variant and comes with Android Lollipop out of the box. The only major specification change has been in the battery capacity where, the LTE version comes with a 2390 mAh battery as compared to the 2070 mAh battery on the 3G version.",
                "Other hardware specs of the phone remain the same as the 3G variant of Moto G Second Gen. The LTE version comes with a 5 inch LCD panel with 720 P resolution which gives the phone a pixel density of 294 PPI. The phone is powered by Qualcomm MSM8926 Snapdragon 400 chipset, which is a Quad Core processor. Moto G Second Gen LTE version is available only in 16 GB memory variant in India at launch and has a slot for Micro SD card. RAM on the device is slightly disappointing at 1 GB, which proves to be a bit of a stumbling block if you like to have too many things running simultaneously. The rear camera is 8 MP while the front snapper is 2 MP for the selfie lovers. You get an option of picking the phone in black or white variants and can replace the back plate on the phone with a plate in the colour of your choice, giving the phone that added a bit of personality.",
