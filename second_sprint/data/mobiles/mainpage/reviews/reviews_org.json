In several keynotes, Apple demonstrated how it was imperative that your thumb is able to reach out to the most extreme corner of the screen for easy usage and that is why they would not budge from the small screen size. However, with the demand for bigger phones on the uprise, Apple decided to give an option to its users with the iPhone 6 Plus. It was the iPhone for those who wanted a big device and made improvements in areas like battery life as well as the camera over the smaller iPhone 6. With the iPhone 6 Plus proving to be quite a hit and doing as well as any phablet out there, Apple gave the device the refresh it deserved with the iPhone 6s on September 9th, 2015."

                "The LG G3 comes in less than a year after the well-received LG G2 was launched. While the G2 was packed to the gills with features, the LG G3 adds even more. For starters, the display is a little bigger at 5.5 inches, but now features an extremely high Quad HD (2560 x 1440 pixel) resolution. This bumps up the pixel density to a whopping 534PPI, making it one of the crispiest screens on the planet right now. Technically, the human eye cannot perceive the difference between pixels beyond 300 PPI pixel density, so despite the predecessor already having crossed that barrier (at 424PPI), we wonder how much of a benefit users will be able to notice with the bumped up resolution. Moving on, its powered by the Snapdragon 801 quad-core 2.5GHz chip, which is the gold-standard for Android flagships right now. Much like Gionees Elife E7, the LG G3 comes in two variants  a 2GB RAM unit with 16GB internal storage, and a 3GB RAM unit with 32GB memory. Whichever may be your preference, there is a microSD card slot on both models to accommodate up to 128GB more storage capacity. Design-wise, the G3 retains the placement of the power and volume buttons at the back of the device, around the camera lens. The metallic back now makes the phone look more appealing, and is available in more colour options (including Gold).",
                "It maintains the 13MP camera sensor with Optical Image Stabilization at the back, but adds a two-tone flash (much like the iPhone 5s and the HTC One M8). But one unique camera feature is the laser-assisted auto-focus; a sensor on the other side of the camera lens that actually fires lasers to ascertain the distance between the subject, resulting in an extremely fast focusing and capturing of photos. Theres also a 1-watt speaker with a boost amplifier that should deliver loud and clear audio output. The 3000mAh battery is now removable and the phone now supports wireless charging too. LG has also flattened their software UI overlay which runs atop Android 4.4 KitKat.",
                "They also sell the LG Circle Case; a flip cover with a circular viewing area when the flip is closed, and a special circular UI assists in using the phone without opening the flip cover. All in all, the LG G3 raises the bar for flagship Android phones for the year 2014, and technologies like Quad HD displays should become standard when the next batch of competition launches."

In several keynotes, Apple demonstrated how it was imperative that your thumb is able to reach out to the most extreme corner of the screen for easy usage and that is why they would not budge from the small screen size. However, with the demand for bigger phones on the uprise, Apple decided to give an option to its users with the iPhone 6 Plus. It was the iPhone for those who wanted a big device and made improvements in areas like battery life as well as the camera over the smaller iPhone 6. With the iPhone 6 Plus proving to be quite a hit and doing as well as any phablet out there, Apple gave the device the refresh it deserved with the iPhone 6s on September 9th, 2015."

But if you look beneath the hood, there is an all new Apple A8 processor (64 bit of course), a significantly improved 8MP camera with image and video stabilization and a new 128GB version. The iPhone 6 Plus comes in 16GB, 64GB and 128GB variants, that's right, no 32GB here. The larger form factor does add to the weight of the device and takes it to 172 gms from the 112 gms on the iPhone 5s. iPhone 6 Plus body has rounded edges, that takes us back to the feel of the original iPhones that we saw before the iPhone 4 introduced flat metal edges.",

The Lumia 950 is the younger sibling of the Lumia 950 XL which is a slightly bigger and beefier version of the Lumia 950. As always with the flagship in the Lumia range of devices, the USP of the Lumia 950 is its camera, which is a 20 MP unit with a unique triple LED natural flash. The phone comes with several modern day additions too, like the USB Type-C connector and support for Fast Charging. Alongside the Lumia 950 XL, it is the first phone to be announced with the latest Windows Phone OS called, Windows 10 out of the box. Some of the features of the device include:"

The screen is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. It has 2GB RAM and has 16GB of internal storage. But it lacks the microSD card slot. It runs Android JellyBean 4.3 and we hope to see an upgrade to this version.",

Lenovo has introduced new software enhancements  for instance you can light up the screen by pressing the volume button, and you can also answer a call by just putting the VIBE Z to your ear.

A full HD display with a resolution of 1920x1080 on a 5\" full touch-screen is only the beginning of this beast. The Xperia Z is powered by a 1.5GHz Quad-core processor and is supported by 2GB of RAM. With computing power exceeding many of our desktops and notebooks, the Z would set the standards for smartphones in 2013. Facing stiff competition from Samsung Galaxy SIII / Note II and HTC's One X series, Sony has thrown the Xperia Z as its response.",
                "Sony hasn't left any stone unturned when it comes to features and spec sheet of the Z. The phone features a 13-megapixel camera that can record full HD videos (1080p), supports Micro SD card expansion along with the 16GB of internal storage and is powered by a 2370 mAh battery. Standard communications options like WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS and NFC are inbuilt. Amazingly the Xperia Z still weighs just 146 gms and is super slim at 7.9mm. Sony sure has packed in everything it needs to give Samsung a run for its money, a good design, specs that are very much up to date for 2013 and the oomph factor that was so far missing. Not just that, Sony has upped the game by making this flagship smartphone water & dust resistant (IP55 & IP57 certification), thus making the Z a rugged yet premium smartphone on the market."

Next is the top-of-the-line Snapdragon 800 chip, bringing sheer brute force at 2.26GHz of clock speed on all four cores. That's paired with 2GB of RAM and either 16GB or 32GB of internal storage. There's no microSD expansion. Design-wise, the most striking thing is the placement of the volume and power buttons at the back of the device, right under the camera sensor. The fastest internet technologies are thrown in  LTE, 3G with speeds of up to 42Mbps and WiFi 802.11ac too.",
                "At the back rests a 13 megapixel camera with Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), enabling less blurry snaps and better low-light performance. It can also record 1080p HD videos at 60 frames per second. It also has multiple mics and noise-cancellation for capturing better sound. On the software side, LG has added a few interesting features  Guest mode allows you to hand over the phone to somebody without them looking at your personal stuff, Audio zooming captures audio of a subject better as compared to the background sounds. There's a reasonably large 3000mAh Lithium Polymer battery which should keep all this mighty hardware running for long. This is the LTE version, that supports the Band 40 that Indian networks like Reliance Jio or Airtel use (2300 MHz)."

                "The LG G2 is the successor to the Optimus G Pro handset from the Korean electronics giant. LG has fitted everything but the kitchen sink in the G2. Starting with the 5.2-inch 1080p IPS display, bringing the display density count to a high 424 PPI. Next is the top-of-the-line Snapdragon 800 chip, bringing sheer brute force at 2.26GHz of clock speed on all four cores. That's paired with 2GB of RAM and either 16GB or 32GB of internal storage. There's no microSD expansion. Design-wise, the most striking thing is the placement of the volume and power buttons at the back of the device, right under the camera sensor. The fastest internet technologies are thrown in  3G with speeds of up to 42Mbps and WiFi 802.11ac too.",
                "At the back rests a 13 megapixel camera with Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), enabling less blurry snaps and better low-light performance. It can also record 1080p HD videos at 60 frames per second. It also has multiple mics and noise-cancellation for capturing better sound. On the software side, LG has added a few interesting features  Guest mode allows you to hand over the phone to somebody without them looking at your personal stuff, Audio zooming captures audio of a subject better as compared to the background sounds. There's a reasonably large 3000mAh Lithium Polymer battery which should keep all this mighty hardware running for long. This is the 32GB internal storage version."

But the biggest industry-disrupting change was the high-resolution \"Retina\" display bearing a resolution of 960 x 640 pixels packed into the same 3.5-inch sized screen. This bore a PPI (Pixel Per Inch) of above 300, beyond which it is near impossible for the human eye to distinguish one pixel from another. They also added a front camera with their own video-calling application between Apple devices, dubbed FaceTime. Apple also introduced its own chip, the single-core A4 for the first time on the iPhone 4. The iPhone 4S got an upgraded dual-core A5 chip in 2011."

Next is the top-of-the-line Snapdragon 800 chip, bringing sheer brute force at 2.26GHz of clock speed on all four cores. That's paired with 2GB of RAM and either 16GB or 32GB of internal storage. There's no microSD expansion. Design-wise, the most striking thing is the placement of the volume and power buttons at the back of the device, right under the camera sensor. The fastest internet technologies are thrown in  LTE, 3G with speeds of up to 42Mbps and WiFi 802.11ac too.",

It can also record 1080p HD videos at 60 frames per second. It also has multiple mics and noise-cancellation for capturing better sound. On the software side, LG has added a few interesting features  Guest mode allows you to hand over the phone to somebody without them looking at your personal stuff, Audio zooming captures audio of a subject better as compared to the background sounds. There's a reasonably large 3000mAh Lithium Polymer battery which should keep all this mighty hardware running for long. This is the top-of-the-line, 32GB LTE version, that supports the Band 40 that Indian networks like Reliance Jio or Airtel use (2300 MHz)."

Above and below that brilliant display are stereo speakers that belt out loud output with good clarity.

The phone supports 4G LTE as well as WiFi's latest standard; 802.11ac. In the camera department, HTC's doing things differently. Enter UltraPixel  the sensor at the back of the HTC One can shoot only 4 megapixels, but the size of individual pixels in the sensor is twice the size found in good camera-phones like the iPhone 5 or 808 PureView. This, coupled with OIS (Optical Image Stabilisation), should give better low-light photography than typical camera-phones. There's also a 2.1MP front-facing camera with HDR support.

The device has a 13 megapixel Sony sensor with flash and a 5 megapixel front facing wide angle camera. The rear camera is capable of recording 4K video and also does 720p slo-mo videos at 120FPS. It has a Quad Core processor clocked at 2.5GHz, Snapdragon 801 for those who are curious and has 3GB of RAM on board. It runs CyanogenMod 11S, an Android fork based on version 4.4 KitKat that adds nifty features like Themes, Privacy Guard etc. Theres even a Moto X-like always-on listening feature where the phone will respond when you say Ok Snapdragon. Also, another similarity to the Moto X is an optional wooden back cover along with denim, linen etc.",

On the connectivity front the device supports many bands for 4G LTE which means that it should deliver the high-speed mobile internet in many countries (including India). It has a large 3100mAh battery on board which should provide decent backup. Abroad, the OnePlus One is sold only via an invite system."

This brings it to above-300PPI mark, thereby making individual pixels indistinguishable. The screen is well protected from scratches thanks to the Gorilla Glass covering. The NVIDIA Tegra 3 1.5GHz quad core processor promises a fantastic browsing and gaming experience. The One X also features 16GB internal storage with 1GB RAM, an 8MP camera with HTC Image Sense chip, 1080p HD video recording and rich sound quality thanks to Beats Audio. An interesting feature of the camera is to take still photos while shooting a video. There's a front-facing 1.3MP front-facing camera for video calls and self portraits. Despite being a high-end phone, you'll love to know that FM Radio is available in the One X. Much like the iPhone, there's 16GB or 32GB of internal storage, but no memory card slot.

The 4S brought an upgraded 8MP camera, faster dual-core A5 chip and a new voice assistant called 'Siri'. Apple also launched iOS 5 and its cloud offering iCloud along with the iPhone 4S.

While the humongous XPERIA Z Ultra caters to a different niche category, the Z1 is Sony's prime-time frontrunner. While the footprint of the Z1 is quite similar to the predecessor, the weight and thickness have gone up a notch. That is possibly owing to all the high-end components packed inside this phone. Design-wise, the XPERIA Z1 now has aluminium wrapped on all borders. While the screen is the same 5-inch 1920 x 1080 pixel TFT panel, the Z1 features Sony's Triluminous tech, which results in rich colour reproduction. The water and dust resistance is also upped a notch with IP58 certification. It is powered by the latest-and-greatest Snapdragon 800 chip, that features a 2.2GHz quad-core chip and powerful Adreno 330 graphics. To complement that is 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage, with a microSD card slot for further expansion.",
                "However, the highlight of the Z1 remains to be the 20.7 megapixel camera sensor at the back. Unlike the Z Ultra, this phone fortunately has an LED flash. It has a truckload of camera-related features, and both it and the front-facing 2MP camera can shoot 1080p HD videos. The battery size has also been increased to 3000 mAh, which should provide the phone all the juice it needs to power its high-end hardware. All possible connectivity options are thrown in, including LTE, WiFi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.0 etc."

This capacitive touch screen has an oleophobic coating and strength of Corning's Gorilla Glass. iPhone 5 gives an internal storage of 16/32/64GB and 1GB RAM. It runs on iOS 6 that brings Apple's own mapping capabilities to the iPhone. This phone is powered by Apple A6 chipset and has a dual-core processor of 1.2 GHz. For data and connectivity, iPhone 5 sustains ultra fast wireless features like 3G, Bluetooth v4.0 with A2DP and dual-band WI-FI.",
                "iPhone 5 comes with an 8MP camera (known as iSight) has features like auto focus, LED flash, simultaneous HD video and image recording, Geo-tagging, face detection and a panorama mode. It gives an image resolution of 3264*2448 pixels. Also, its secondary front-facing camera of 1.2 MP enhances FaceTime video calls with 1080p HD video quality at 30 fps. The most pivotal change is the replacement of 30 pin adaptor to a simple Lightning connector which is more durable, and is reversible i.e. plugged in either way. Apart from this, iPhone 5 includes apps like Siri  the personal assistant, iCloud that gives instant access to your contents, Maps by Apple which are 3D interactive and the all new EarPods that come with your box of iPhone 5. It runs on a standard Li-ion battery of 1440 mAh which sustains up to 8 hours of talk-time and up to 225 hours in stand-by mode. It is available Black/Slate and White/Silver Colors.

But the biggest industry-disrupting change was the high-resolution \"Retina\" display bearing a resolution of 960 x 640 pixels packed into the same 3.5-inch sized screen. This bore a PPI (Pixel Per Inch) of above 300, beyond which it is near impossible for the human eye to distinguish one pixel from another. They also added a front camera with their own video-calling application between Apple devices, dubbed FaceTime. Apple also introduced its own chip, the single-core A4 for the first time on the iPhone 4. The iPhone 4S got an upgraded dual-core A5 chip in 2011."

                "The LG G Pro Lite is a mid-range phablet from the Korean phone maker; after showing their newly-regained strength in the high-end smartphone segment with the G2. The G Pro Lite features a 5.5-inch IPS panel but with a relatively low 960 x 540 pixel resolution. One distinction between the original G Pro and this model is the presence of a stylus, that fits into the shell of the phone. The G Pro Lite is powered by a dual-core 1GHz Mediatek MT6577 chipset, typically found on Android smartphones built by Indian phone makers, and now even appearing on multi-national brand handsets like the Sony XPERIA C. But the variant used in the LG G Pro Lite is lower than the Mediatek MT6589 quad-core variety typically seen. Coupled with that is 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage.",

In the camera department, this smartphone has an 8 megapixel rear-facing sensor and a 1.3MP front-facing one. The phone can record 1080p HD videos. The phone also has stereo speakers at the base. There's a massive 3140 mAh battery powering this phone, and given the comparatively non-intensive hardware components, we hope the battery life should shine. Competition from phablets priced nearby would include the Huawei Ascend Mate and the Samsung Mega 5.8."

The iPhone 5s retains the same 4-inch 1136 x 640 pixel IPS panel. Internally though, there are drastic changes. It is powered by the new A7 chip, which Apple claims can be twice as fast as the A6. It is also 64-bit enabled and has the 'M7' co-processor dedicated for motion sensing  which can automate actions on the basis of what you're doing. The most unique feature Apple can boasting about the 5s is 'Touch ID'  a fingerprint sensor that's built into the home button. So, instead of having to punch in four-digit passcodes or alphanumeric passwords, Touch ID can authenticate the user by scanning his or her fingerprint.",
                "Although the camera has the same 8 megapixels resolution, the sensor and aperture are larger. Also, there are LED flashes which have two different colour tones, which with the help of software fire aptly to accurately illuminate the subject. It can also record videos in an extremely high 120 fps frame-rate. While the iPhone 5 was an LTE 4G enabled phone, it only supported bands that were compatible in certain countries. The iPhone 5s brings in TD-LTE support, which has been adopted by operators in India and China. This is the middle variant with 32GB of internal storage."

The phone has a 13 megapixel camera unit with features such as dual shot (allowing you to take picture with front and rear camera at same time), drama shots (taking burst of photos and overlap them), cinema photo (allowing one part of photo to move while other is still), make GIFs and pre-made templates.

The 4S brought an upgraded 8MP camera, faster dual-core A5 chip and a new voice assistant called 'Siri'. Apple also launched iOS 5 and its cloud offering iCloud along with the iPhone 4S. With increasing media content, apps, games and books, Apple also gave hardcore users a 64GB capacity since the iPhone 4S.

It maintains the same design philosophy of the Xperia lineup and has a big 5-inch display, but with a comparatively low qHD (960 x 540 pixel) resolution. It is a dual-SIM handset with software settings that allow you to automatically set which SIM should be used what time of the day. Instead of Qualcomm, which is used in almost all of Sony's Android smartphones, the Xperia C is powered by a Mediatek MT6589 chip (the same that powers phones like the Micromax Canvas 4). It is a quad-core 1.2GHz CPU, complemented by 1GB of RAM and 4GB of internal memory (we trust about half of that should be available to the user). Using a microSD card, you can add up to 32GB more storage. The 3G speeds can soar as high as 42.2Mbps on this phone, and you have Bluetooth 4.0 and WiFi 802.11n support too.",

Sony claims the Exmor R tech and support for HDR and other camera-related software tweaks will set it apart from the crowd. Delivering juice to the Xperia C is a reasonably large 2370 mAh battery, which along with Sony's \"Stamina Mode\" battery-saving software feature, should deliver good up-time.

                "The previous HTC One (codename: M7) was a critically acclaimed smartphone of 2013. It is only unfortunate that it wasn't as big a commercial success to revive HTC's dwindling fortunes. Except for the lacking camera performance, the HTC One was otherwise a top-notch phone. And this year, HTC has built the next HTC One, keeping all the good things about the previous one. Called the HTC One (M8), this handset is a little narrower, a little shorter, a little thinner and has rounded corners and curvier edges at the back, which make it easier to hold. More importantly, now uses even little plastic in its body than its predecessor, being made almost entirely out of smooth aluminium. Screen size is bumped up a little to 5-inches, while still maintaining the 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution. It retains the front-facing 'BoomSound' stereo speakers, that are said to deliver even louder and richer sound than the original set on the HTC One. The buttons underneath the screen are gone, now replaced with onscreen buttons like the Nexus series.",
                "It is powered by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 quad-core chip grunting at 2.5GHz. Paired with the same 2GB of RAM, it comes with 16GB or 32GB internal memory, and a microSD card slot to expand further. There are two cameras at the back that are used (the same 4MP UltraPixels type like the earlier One) to capture depth information. The Duo camera setup lets you change the focus point in an image after it is clicked. It features a duo-tone LED flash, much like the iPhone 5s, to retain natural skin colour tones. Unlike the or , the One M8 cannot record 4K videos (although the hardware is exactly the same, it does 1080p Full HD). Since the selfies trend is on the rise, there's a 5MP BSI sensor up front.",
                "It runs HTC Sense 6 atop , that comes with an improved version of HTC's BlinkFeed and camera enhancements. There's a 2600mAh battery that should power this beastly hardware, along with an ultra power saving mode (like the Galaxy S5) that shuts everything off other than phone-calls, SMS and email. An interesting dotted flip cover shows basic info without having to open the flip. This is the model with 16GB of internal storage."

When compared to the premium BlackBerry Q10, there are a few changes that distinguish the two. First and foremost, the Q5 is more youthful-looking, differs in the design of the QWERTY keys and has a plasticky appearance. The Q10 is a world-phone supporting both CDMA and GSM networks, but the Q5 supports only GSM. But on the bright side, it retains LTE; the next generation high-speed internet technology. Instead of Super AMOLED, BlackBerry has chosen to go with an IPS touchscreen panel in the Q5, but maintains the same 720 x 720 pixel resolution in a 3.1-inch screen size. Memory is halved to 8GB, and the processor is a slightly slower 1.2GHz dual-core variant (the Q10 has a 1.5GHz dual-core). But both fortunately have 2GB of RAM. The camera is also downgraded from an 8MP sensor to a 5MP one at the back, but the Q5 has the same 2MP front-facing camera for video calls. Battery capacity is almost the same at 2180 mAh."

Sporting a 4.3\" Super AMOLED Plus display and a 8.5mm thin body, the SGS2 packed a lot of charm on the design side. In terms of raw horsepower, the Samsung Galaxy S2 features a 1.2GHz processor, Mali-400MP GPU and 1GB RAM to back it up. The Galaxy SII has strong media capabilities with a 8MP camera capable of 1080p (Full HD) recording. By early 2012, Samsung sold as many as 20 million SGS2 devices worldwide, partly contributing to the market share growth seen by the South Korean giant.

It boasts a 5 inch IPS HD Display with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels which translates into a crispy pixel density of 441PPI. The display is made by either Sharp or LG, both of which are known to supply displays to Apple for its iPhone and iPad. It is known to have great viewing angles and colours appear vibrant. Under the hood, there is a Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor which clocks at 2.3GHz. The processor is paired with 2GB RAM and backed by an Adreno 330 GPU. The chipset is very powerful and capable enough to churn any task thrown at it efficiently. Similar hardware is used in the Google Nexus 5.",
                "Xiaomi Mi3 sports a 13 Megapixel Exmor sensor which is provided by Sony. The snapper has been aided by a Dual-LED flash (made by Philips), which will enable the device to capture good images even in low-light conditions. The smartphone even supports Full HD video recording as well. Also, there is a 2 megapixel secondary camera included for video calling and selfies. The only drawback of this phone is that it supports Single-SIM. We just hope that this does not become Achilles Heels for Xiaomi. On the Connectivity front it offers Bluetooth, WiFi, GPS, NFC etc. There is no 4G connectivity. The beast is powered by a 3050mAh battery, which as per company claims should allow the user to surf seamlessly for 21 hours on 3G network. It comes in two variants, 16GB and 64GB of internal memory but lacks an external card slot."

Since the phone is available only in black colour, it does manage to look classy, despite barely anything significant about it from the design perspective. The screen on the phone is a 5-inch IPS panel with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels. This equates to a pixel density of 294PPI. There is Gorilla Glass protection on the phone, so if you drop your phone too often, there would be at least some protection.",

On paper, the specifications look fairly modest, and something that you should expect in this price. However, if you have your reservations against the Spreadtrum processor, there is the Xolo Era 4K with a MediaTek chipset which is a good pick in the price range. The phone runs Android 5.1 Lollipop at launch, but Xolo has explicitly stated that the phone can be upgraded to Marshmallow.

                "The LG G3 comes in less than a year after the well-received LG G2 was launched. While the G2 was packed to the gills with features, the LG G3 adds even more. For starters, the display is a little bigger at 5.5 inches, but now features an extremely high Quad HD (2560 x 1440 pixel) resolution. This bumps up the pixel density to a whopping 534PPI, making it one of the crispiest screens on the planet right now. Technically, the human eye cannot perceive the difference between pixels beyond 300 PPI pixel density, so despite the predecessor already having crossed that barrier (at 424PPI), we wonder how much of a benefit users will be able to notice with the bumped up resolution. Moving on, its powered by the Snapdragon 801 quad-core 2.5GHz chip, which is the gold-standard for Android flagships right now. Much like Gionees Elife E7, the LG G3 comes in two variants  a 2GB RAM unit with 16GB internal storage, and a 3GB RAM unit with 32GB memory. Whichever may be your preference, there is a microSD card slot on both models to accommodate up to 128GB more storage capacity. Design-wise, the G3 retains the placement of the power and volume buttons at the back of the device, around the camera lens. The metallic back now makes the phone look more appealing, and is available in more colour options (including Gold).",
                "It maintains the 13MP camera sensor with Optical Image Stabilization at the back, but adds a two-tone flash (much like the iPhone 5s and the HTC One M8). But one unique camera feature is the laser-assisted auto-focus; a sensor on the other side of the camera lens that actually fires lasers to ascertain the distance between the subject, resulting in an extremely fast focusing and capturing of photos. Theres also a 1-watt speaker with a boost amplifier that should deliver loud and clear audio output. The 3000mAh battery is now removable and the phone now supports wireless charging too. LG has also flattened their software UI overlay which runs atop Android 4.4 KitKat.",
                "They also sell the LG Circle Case; a flip cover with a circular viewing area when the flip is closed, and a special circular UI assists in using the phone without opening the flip cover. All in all, the LG G3 raises the bar for flagship Android phones for the year 2014, and technologies like Quad HD displays should become standard when the next batch of competition launches."

This is the first Windows Phone to have software buttons, and also the first one to not have a dedicated camera shutter button. The chipset is now a more powerful quad-core Snapdragon 400 running at 1.2GHz. It has 512MB of RAM, which might sound insufficient while playing high-end games or apps, but should be just fine for typical usage.",

The Lumia 630s got a run-of-the-mill 5 megapixel AF camera at the back, but unfortunately misses out on the LED flash, just like the Lumia 520. Not only does the LED flashlight help in taking low-light pictures, it also comes in handy as a torch. Theres no secondary video-call camera either, which again is disappointing given the deep integration of Skype in Windows Phone 8.1.
