On the exterior, it sure does seem so  as the One mini retains the same unibody aluminum enclosure that people love on the HTC One. The screen is smaller at 4.3-inches, thereby reducing the width of the handset and to make one-handed operation easier. The resolution is dropped down from Full HD to 1280 x 720 pixels, but owing to the smaller screen size, the handset still has a pretty sharp screen. The chipset is also a dual-core Snapdragon 400 running at 1.4GHz, unlike the quad-core chip powering the big brother. The RAM is halved to 1GB, internal memory too is cut by half to 16GB, also without any microSD card slot for expansion.",
                "The HTC One mini has high-speed Internet connectivity in the form of 4G LTE support, along with WiFi and 3G. Missing in the connectivity department are NFC and the Infrared port, which are available on the One. In the camera department, the One mini retains the 4 UltraPixel camera of its sibling, but loses the Optical Image Stabilization. Nonetheless, it can record 1080p HD videos at a smooth frame rate. There's a 1.6MP front-facing camera for video-calls too. The One mini has a smaller 1800 mAh battery, but considering the comparatively lower resolution screen and chipset, it should hopefully suffice."

                "The Samsung Galaxy Golden is an Android-based smartphone with a flip form factor that's almost not to be seen these days. But the word 'Golden' in the name indicates the golden finish on the sides of the phone. It fuses two similarly sized 3.7-inch Super AMOLED displays back-to-back with a traditional numeric keypad. They have a reasonable 800 x 480 pixel resolution, and thanks to a 'hidden receiver', one can make calls even with the flip closed. Being a touchscreen phone, we also assume the phone would be entirely operational without having to open the flip. Samsung has created the flip to cater to the niche audience who misses the form factor and also prefers using buttons while dialling a phone number. Other than this, it's pretty much a mid-range smartphone on the inside  a dual-core 1.7GHz Snapdragon 400 chipset, 1.5GB RAM, 16GB internal storage.",
                "At the back you've got an 8 megapixel shooter and a 1.9MP cam for video calls/selfies. The 1820 mAh battery inside sounds a little less given the mid-range specs; but looking at the relatively low resolution display, hopefully the phone gets by the entire day on a single charge. Samsung is targeting the premium audience for this phone; with a price tag of Rs. 51,900 at launch."

It is a successor to the Note 2; and brings evolutionary changes to the table. Starting with the dimensions, it has the same footprint but is a millimeter thinner and noticeably lighter. The back of the device has a stitched leather finish, which is unique. But despite the same footprint, the Note 3 manages to fit in a slightly larger 5.7-inch display. The resolution is now bumped up to 1920 x 1080 pixels, a.k.a Full HD. The screen is of the Super AMOLED variety. The processor is bumped up to a Quad-core 2.3GHz (LTE) or 1.9GHz (3G) depending upon the variant your country has. In India, the chipset will mostly be the latter, which has two separate quad-core chips that switch depending upon usage. The RAM is also upped to 3GB, which possibly is the highest in a smartphone today. Internal memory starts at a capacious 32GB, with a microSD card slot for further expansion. All possible forms of modern-day networking supports are available  LTE, 3G, WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, NFC etc. Speaking of connectivity, the Note 3 is also the first phone to feature USB 3.0 support, which will enable high-speed data transfers from computer to phone.",
                "In the camera department, it gets the 13 megapixel sensor like the Galaxy S4, but yet another never-before-seen feature is the support for 4K resolution recording. Unfortunately, only the LTE version of the Note 3 has this feature; the ones sold in India, that are powered by Samsung's Exynos processor, can shoot only up to 1080p HD. The front-facing 2MP camera can do 1080p HD recording too. There are a plethora of software features that Samsung has added to the Note 3 that enhances the active stylus functionality we've experienced with the previous Note handsets (watch the video above to check them out). Powering all these features is a slightly larger 3200 mAh battery inside."

There are many things common amongst both the handsets  the 4.5-inch qHD (960 x 540 pixel) display, the stereo speakers, 1GB of RAM and 8GB internal storage. Dimensionally, the Desire 601 is just a tad thicker than the Desire 600, assumingly due to the larger 2100 mAh battery inside. A larger battery seems to be in place to keep the phone running longer on 4G LTE. Even 3G speeds are faster on the Desire 601  maxing out at 42 Mbps. The major complaint the Desire 600 had was the Qualcomm Snapdragon 200, a quad-core chip meant for inexpensive Android handsets. The Desire 601 fixes that with a Snapdragon 400 on-board, which is a dual-core chip but running at a faster 1.4GHz speed. This chipset also has a better Adreno 305 GPU. Certain things have been downsized though  the camera is dropped from 8MP to 5MP, the front-facing cam from 1.6MP to a VGA (0.3MP) one.

Also, it is about 40 grams lighter and due to the smaller 5-inch display, has gotten trimmed with respect to height and width too. This should make the phone easier to hold and use with one hand. While the display size has gone down by half an inch, the resolution remains the same 1920 x 1080 pixels, resulting in a high 441 PPI pixel density. The next aspect that is changed from the K900 is the chipset  while it was powered by a 2GHz Intel Atom chip, the Vibe X has a more traditional Mediatek 6589T 1.5GHz quad-core chip, found on most Indian phone makers flagship units.",

One unfortunate fact is the battery, which is bumped down to 2000 mAh from 2500 mAh. We hope though that the different chipset offsets the lack of battery capacity and provides a fair uptime."

                "The Oppo R1 is a camera-focused smartphone from the chinese manufacturer. The device sports an 8 megapixel Sony BSI sensor with 5P lens and F2.0 aperture. There's a Blue Glass filter that ensures the sensor captures the best possible pictures in low light condition. The front camera is a 5 megapixel wide angle camera which makes it easier to click group selfies. The front camera also has a blue glass filter just like the rear camera. The software on the phone has also been tweaked to use an independent graphics processing chip to control the Auto Focus, Auto Exposure and Auto White balance before clicking a picture.",
                "The R1 has a thin magnesium alloy frame, measuring 7.1mm. It has a 5 inch IPS display with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels, bringing the pixel density to 294 PPI. The display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3 and should offer decent protection. It has a 1.3GHz Quad Core processor with 1GB of RAM. The device has 16GB of memory which sadly is non-expandable. The R1 runs Oppos Color OS on top of Android 4.2 JellyBean which is an outdated version of the OS. The device has Gesture search where one can draw a gesture on the screen to launch an app. The smart motion feature uses the multiple sensors to answer a call, mute it or to dial a number. The phone has a dedicated PA amplifier for the speaker on the device. The Oppo R1 is a dual SIM device with a non-removable 2410 mAh battery unit. Although the feature list of this phone is impressive, the Moto X is more value for money."

The camera highlights include a 13 megapixel sensor and a 2MP front-facing cam. The phone's back comes in a bright red colour which should give it a distinctive look. There's a 2000 mAh battery powering the Lenovo S820. Interestingly, this phone is a Single SIM device; which is a rarity for phones in this price range  that are seen to sport dual SIM support."

                "The Sony XPERIA Z Ultra which is available is Black & White colour is based on the XPERIA Z flagship handset from Sony in 2013. The most prominent change is the increase in the display size to a whopping 6.4 inches, making it a smartphone with one of the biggest displays available today (although the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 is pretty close). Although it still retains the same 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution as the XPERIA Z, its still above 300 PPI which should not hamper clarity to the human eye. The next upgrade is the bump up to IP58 certification; making the phone more resilient to water and dust. It is also faster internally, being powered by the current top-of-the-line Snapdragon 800 chipset, clocked at a furiously fast 2.2 GHz. Rest of the specs are similar  2GB of RAM and 16GB on-board storage coupled with a microSD card slot for further expansion. The battery size is also upped to 3050 mAh (from the 2330 mAh battery in the Z), which is good news considering the heavy-duty hardware powering this phone. Now for some bad news  the camera resolution is downgraded from 13 megapixels on the XPERIA Z to 8 megapixels. What's more disappointing is that there isn't an LED flash on the Z Ultra, which could make night-time photography difficult. "

It runs on Android 4.2 Jelly Bean and has a 1.2 GHz quad-core MediaTek MT6589 processor with PowerVR SGX544 GPU and 1GB of RAM (the processor and RAM have been unchanged). Besides, there is a 4GB of internal storage (of which approximately 2 GB would be available to the user), and can be expanded by up to 32GB using a microSD card. The phone comes with an 8-megapixel rear camera with LED flash and BSI sensor and is capable of recording videos at 1080p, and has a 2-megapixel front camera with support for video calling. There has been a significant improvement in the camera as compared to its predecessor, which lacked HD recording and BSI sensor for low light photography. Also Face-detection and Panorama have been added along with Geo-tagging.",

This drives the pixel down to a little less than 200 PPI, which isn't as pixel dense as its competitors. Nonetheless, if big screen is what you like, then you get that aplenty with the Mega series. It runs on an unspecified 1.4 GHz dual-core processor, coupled with the same 1.5GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage as its elder brother. No worries though, the chipset seems to be capable enough of handling 1080p HD video recording via the 8 megapixel sensor at the back. The front sensor is also the same as the Mega 6.3 at 1.9MP. The Mega 5.8 has a relatively smaller 2600 mAh battery, but that's exactly the same as the Galaxy S4. And if the S4 can drive a Full HD display and top-of-the-line chipset specs with that much power, the Mega 5.8 should not let you down in terms of battery life."

Mind you, it looks a lot like 3rd party styluses available for iPads and not like the 'S-Pen' stylus that comes with the Samsung Galaxy Note II. There doesn't seem to be a dedicated slot to place it inside the phone, nor does the tip seem as thin and pointy as the S-Pen. Micromax advertises the preloaded Evernote Skitch app which lets you draw using the bundled stylus. Again, remember that this app is freely available on typical Android phones too.",
                "The display is generously large at 5.3-inches, bearing a relatively low 854 x 480 pixel resolution. The Canvas Doodle A111 is powered by a quad-core Snapdragon 1.2 GHz chip and 512MB of RAM. There's 4GB of flash storage, and a microSD card slot for expansion. A highlight of the phone would be the 8 megapixel camera at the back with dual-LED flash and a 2MP camera up front. The phone is powered by a 2100 mAh battery, which should serve fairly considering the medium-grade specs."

                "A comparatively large 2.6-inch touch screen, Full QWERTY keyboard, 3G support and a 1GHz processor  that's the Asha 303. Hailing from the Touch & Type series from Nokia, the Asha 303 may not be a smartphone, yet supports apps like Whatsapp and Angry Birds. Weighing just 99 grams, the phone is fairly light. There may be just about 100MB of internal storage, but thankfully the Asha 303 has a microSD card slot. The camera has a fixed focus and records video in a rather low VGA resolution and at a choppy 15 fps frame-rate. Other than 3G, there's also support for WiFi. The 1300 mAh battery should prove to be sufficient for days of usage, considering the comparatively low specs on the phone."

The phones size makes it handy to use and the Dual-SIM support along with 3G Connectivity, adds to the functionality of this device. Bluetooth, WiFi and GPS are also included. To juice this device, there is a 1800mAh battery, which should be sufficient to power this device for a day.

It is powered by an undeclared 1.2GHz dual-core processor, a reasonable 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage. We suppose the chipset may not be very powerful, as the Galaxy Core can only record videos in 480p non-HD resolution. It's got a 5MP camera at the back with an LED flash, and a VGA front-facing camera. Its 1800 mAh battery sounds a little less than what we'd like."

This handset comes with Android 4.1 Jelly Bean from the start. The 3.15MP camera at the back unfortunately is fixed-focus. Worse yet, it isn't complemented by a LED flash, much like the Lumia 520. Connectivity-wise, there's 3G with speeds up to 7.2 Mbps and WiFi support. FM Radio listeners will appreciate the presence of this feature in the Xperia E. The 1530 mAh battery at the back, given the fairly mediocre hardware, should not depreciate that quick."

The Nokia X+ comes in the same colourful shells like the rest of the Lumia series, but runs something very different than Windows Phone inside. Its Android; but not traditional Android like you know it. It is Android thats void of all Google services; like Maps, Gmail, YouTube etc, that are replaced with Microsofts services. Its UI is also a cross between the Windows Phones Tile-based interface coupled with the Fastlane multi-tasking system found on the Asha 500 series. So whats the benefit? Because of the Android base, Nokia says existing Android apps can be easily ported to the Nokia X software platform. Theres also the possibility of sideloading APK files directly. Nokia has their own app store to discover new apps for the Nokia X+.",

Its got a 4-inch 800 x 480 pixel IPS display and a 1GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4 chip. While the Nokia X had 512MB RAM, the X+ comes with 768MB, thus allowing more apps to run at the same time. Theres 4GB of internal storage (Lumia 520 has 8GB), along with a microSD card slot to expand it further (a 4GB card comes bundled). Theres a lacklustre-sounding 3 megapixel fixed-focus camera at the back with no flash, and no front-facing camera for video calls. The Nokia X+ is a Dual SIM phone with 3G support. The Nokia X+ also comes with Nokias HERE maps with offline navigation, Nokia MixRadio streaming music service and one month of unlimited Skype-Out calls. A 1500mAh battery provides juice to this phone."

The screen has a low resolution and a low pixel density, which means that the display is not sharp and crisp enough to please the eye. But, it is acceptable for a phone of this price range. The smartphone is powered by a 1GHz Dual-core processor alongside 512MB RAM. The hardware is satisfactory. There is an internal memory of 512MB of which 90MB is available to the user. Although thats not going to be enough to run more than a couple of apps, at least there is a microSD card slot for memory expansion up to 32GB.",

The USP of this device is that it offers 3G Connectivity along with Dual-SIM support. Bluetooth and WiFi are also available. It runs on Android v4.2 Jelly Bean and comes in black and red colours. The Lava 3G 356 is a similar smartphone."

The interface is completely re-designed; keeping touchscreens in mind and optimised for a smaller screen size. The phone has a 3-inch QVGA capacitive display and comes in bright coloured shells that are interchangeable. It has a lockscreen that permanently stays on, showing the time and notifications. The Asha 501 has a petite form factor. It is a dual-SIM phone and both the SIMs are hot-swappable. There is 128MB of internal memory and a microSD card slot for expansion (Nokia is bundling a 4GB card along with the package).",
                "Being an inexpensive handset, Nokia has chosen not to include 3G, just 2G and WiFi support for Internet. But server-side compression while web-browsing makes the experience better. There's a 3.2MP camera at the back but does not have an LED flash. Basics like FM Radio and Bluetooth are covered. The Asha Software Platform 1.0 that powers this phone has an interesting User Interface element called 'FastLane'. This shows you the last 50 actions that you have performed with the phone. Sensors like an accelerometer and a proximity sensor, that are usually found in smartphones, are put in the Asha 501. The phone comes built-in with many popular apps like Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, an email client etc. and also 40 games. More can be downloaded from the Nokia Store. The battery life is also deemed to be good  it has a whopping 40+ day standby life."

This phone is quite comfortable to hold because of its petite sizing, and sports a 4-inch 800 x 480 pixel Super AMOLED display, much like the first Galaxy S i9000. It is powered by a ARM Cortex A9 based dual-core chip grunting at 1GHz. Couple that with the 768MB of RAM, it is just about powerful to run the updated Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. Internal storage comes in either 8GB or 16GB sizes, with a microSD card slot for further expansion. The 5 megapixel autofocus camera at the back can record 720p HD videos at a smooth 30 fps frame-rate. Plus, there's a 1.3MP front-facing camera as well.

If that wasn't enough, it is also an IPS panel; which should deliver better viewing angles. The display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 2 and should provide good protection from scratches. The processor is a Snapdragon 400 Quad-core chip clocked at 1.6GHz. It has 1GB of RAM onboard and must be adequate for apps nowadays. The device comes with 8GB of storage which can be expanded to 64GB via a microSD card slot. The device has an 8 megapixel snapper with flash and a 1.3 megapixel front facing camera. The device runs the MIUI interface on top of Android 4.3 Jelly Bean out of the box. It has a changeable 2000mAh Li-Po battery. Last but not the least, its a Dual SIM phone, unlike Xiaomis high-end Mi3 model. Bottom line  the phone offers better specs than the Moto G at the price of the Moto E."

But when you have the Galaxy SIII measuring in at 4.8 inches, plus a few other Samsung handsets that go beyond the 5-inch barrier, maybe it is apt to call it \"mini\". So, that 4-inch Super AMOLED display has a reasonable 800 x 480 pixel resolution. The SIII mini i8190 is not just mini in size, it is stripped off the premium features of its big brother. Like the processor is a dual-core 1GHz, or the camera is just 5 megapixel with a 0.3MP front-facing camera. At least the RAM is kept intact at 1GB, also internal storage is fairly ample at 8GB or 16GB capacities. It runs Android 4.1 Jelly Bean with Samsung's latest TouchWIZ overlay. Since the SIII mini doesn't have power-hungry components like a quad-core processor or an HD screen like its elder sibling, the battery capacity is lowered to 1500 mAh, which should be fair given this handset's spec. Unfortunately, the SIII mini never saw the light of day in the Indian market."

Nokia launched the lower priced Lumia 710 alongside the Lumia 800. Featuring the same 1.4GHz processor of its elder brother, the Lumia 710 scaled down the display quality (a mediocre TFT panel in comparison to the AMOLED one on the Lumia 800), camera (5MP vs. 8MP) and design to deliver a cheaper Windows Phone. There's just 8GB of internal storage with no facility to expand using a microSD card slot. There's 3G connectivity with speeds up to 14.4 Mbps and WiFi 802.11n support. The battery is also just 1300 mAh (as opposed to the 1450 mAh one in the Lumia 800), but this is a removable one. Competing with Samsung Omnia W, the Lumia 710 much like any other Windows Phone 7.x handset out there will not receive an update to the Windows Phone 8 OS. Numerically, the Lumia 720 can be called as the successor to the Lumia 710, but pricing-wise, the Lumia 620 would be its apt successor. Both these phones fix most of the above-mentioned issues that plagued the first generation of Windows Phone 7 handsets."

It's got a 2.4-inch QVGA (320 x 240 pixels) display, a microSD card slot supporting up to 32GB cards. The striking physical characteristic of the Asha 210 is the dedicated WhatsApp button on the phone. Yes, HTC had a Facebook button on the ChaCha, Nokia has put the hugely popular multi-platform instant messenger that almost everybody we know uses. This is a big plus as compared to feature phones like the REX series from Samsung, which don't support WhatsApp at the moment. If that wasn't enough, Nokia's also announced that WhatsApp won't be charging their yearly fee of Rs. 50 for these handsets. Being an inexpensive phone, there's no 3G support, but other than 2G, you also have WiFi. Following the trend of dual SIM phones set by Indian phone makers like Micromax, the Asha 210 also comes with two SIM slots, one of which is hot-swappable. There's a 2MP camera at the back off which we wouldn't expect great quality. But there are some unique tricks, like built-in voice guidance that makes taking self-portraits easy without a front-facing camera."

                "The Asha series has seemed to appeal to those people who are looking for a basic touch-phone which can run Whatsapp. Yes, even this phone supports Whatsapp even though technically it can be called a non-smartphone. Going by specs, the phone features a 2.8 inches screen with a resolution of 320x240 pixels, which boils down to a low pixel density of 143PPI but is acceptable for a phone of this price. It runs a touch-optimised version of the classic Series 40 interface, so you need not frown at the hardware specifications like the unmentioned processor name and the paltry-sounding 64MB RAM. For storage, there is hardly any internal memory but there is a microSD card slot which supports upto 32GB memory cards.",
                "This handy device has a 1.3 Megapixel camera but lacks a flash. Apart from Whatsapp, the phone even offers Facebook, Twitter, LINE and WeChat. It has Radio and a music player. The drawbacks of this device are that it is a Single-SIM phone, lacks WiFi and 3G connectivity. So only 2G data connection can be used to connect your phone to the internet. Moreover, it supports a Micro-SIM. It is available in six colours- Black, White, Red, Green, Cyan and Yellow. If you seek features like WiFi, then check out the Asha 501 which costs a little more."

Both the handsets are visually similar and the only difference between the two is that the Asha 200 is a dual SIM capable device while the 201 doesn't get that capability. The Asha 201 gets a 320*240 pixel, 2.4 inch display and comes with an internal memory of 10 MB. As this being grossly inadequate, the phone supports microSD cards of up to 32 GB in size. The phone also gets a basic 2 megapixel camera which can also capture videos at basic QCIF resolution at a measly 10 fps. But the main highlight of the Asha 201 is  this is one of the cheapest phones to support WhatsApp. Yup, WhatsApp is selectively available for certain Series 40 handsets from Nokia."

Adoring the rear of this handset is the 8 MP HD Primary Camera which can also capture full HD videos. There also is a 1.3 MP Secondary Camera. The handset currently runs Android v4.0.4 (Ice Cream Sandwich)  and as expected, is Dual SIM capable with one SIM supporting 3G network. The battery on this phablet is rated at 2500 mAH which again is quite a lot  but the large display may not warrant a long battery life."

                "The Nokia 208 is a very basic entry level handset from the Finnish phone maker. It has a typical candy-bar form factor with a num-pad for input and runs the 'non-smart' Series 40 interface. Its got a 2.4-inch QVGA (320 x 240 pixel) display and other barebones specifications. For example, the camera is just 1.3 megapixels, so can't expect great quality snaps from it. The only interesting thing about the Nokia 208 is the 3G support  it can serve internet speeds of up to 7.2 Mbps. But it is questionable how much high-speed internet will you be able to enjoy on that tiny screen in the first place; maybe tethering to a computer using the data cable would be a use-case."
